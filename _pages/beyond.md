My well-deserved free time is roughly split in three (non equal) parts. 

## *Mens sana —*
I like not to restrict the intellectual activity only to science-related grounds. I am curious and passionate about geopolitical literature. I am a reader of [Limes](https://www.limesonline.com/) and [Domino](https://www.rivistadomino.it/), two monthly publications that gathers the analyses of both italian and foreign scholars, technicians and thinkers. The main focuses of these reviews are the structural and long-term impacts and meaning of the world's anthopo-dynamical phenomena. Beyond the factuality of the themes, what I look for in this kind of material is not the mere "news", but rather the epistemological toolkit to have an idea of the anthropological nature of the events we witness. 

## *— In corpore sano*
Some time in the week *must* be allocated to fitness. It is a way to stay in shape and to harmonize the use of both the brain and the body, which can not go along independent paths. I like calisthenics, which gives the possibility to work out at home with no (or minimal) equipment. I find this activity useful for both physical as well as mental restistence. The consistency and the perseverance required are known to give the desired effects on the long-term. 
> The achivement I am particularly proud of is **1000 push-ups** in less that 90 minutes.

Beyond this, I like mountain-hiking, ice skating and boulder-climbing. I practice Krav Maga, a hand-to-hand combat and self-defense technique. I am student of the [KMA School](https://kma.it/la-scuola-kma/). In February 2025 I achived the yellow belt, the first expertise level.

## Guitar
I started playing guitar at the age of 12 years. I am not a professional musician. It is an activity I cultivate for the pure pleasure of recreating the vibes of the genres I love. From the early acoustic Blues of the Mississippi Delta, to the 70s and 80s Rock, and far beyond. 

I like to discover, explore and train on the techniques and styles of my reference guitar figures. For example finger and mixed picking, slide guitar. The guitar professionals and poets I most look up at are—but not limited to—Mark Knopfler, Jimmy Page, David Gilmour, Mississippi Fred McDowell, Stevie Ray Vaughan.
