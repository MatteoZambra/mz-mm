## Data Science at Aquafil Group
##### About Aquafil
The company operates in the chemical-textile manufacturing industry, with a strong focus on sustainability. Its flagship product, [ECONYL®](https://econyl.aquafil.com/), is a synthetic fiber made from regenerated nylon sourced from end-of-life carpets, textile scraps, and fishing nets. The regeneration process may be infinitely repeated to retrieve the basic raw material. This reflects the company’s commitment to driving positive change in environmental sustainability.

Aquafil's headquarters are located in Arco, Italy, in a picturesque region framed by the Alps and Garda Lake. The company also has plants in the United States, China, Chile, Japan, Croatia, Thailand, and Slovenia.

##### The experience
Aquafil is my first employer after the academic start of career. What I sought, and found, is the proximity to what someone might call *Gemba*—japanese for "the production floor", where value is created. The contact with the manufacturing operations implies a strong connection between the data I use daily and their real-world physical and phenomenological pertinence. The synergy between algorithmic techniques and domain expertise is what we search in order to ensure utility, quality and robustness.

##### My contribution
My contribution to the company involves leveraging proprietary data and scientific knowledge to develop explanatory and predictive models, and ready-to-use software tools. The value I bring is focused on automating and harmonizing quality control processes, analyzing chemical-physical processes. 

My role in the scope of Aquafil's mission is to help in digitalization process. In my case, this means
- to propose and implement data-driven explanatory and predictive models for the automation, harmonization of quality control processes
- to analyze and obtain information from proprietary data sets. These data come from the observation of physical-chemical processes, production machines and quality control tests
- to provide ready-to-use software solutions to assist sector-specific operations

So far, I found this experience stimulating and instructive. This is due to both the mentioned real-world manufacturing processes exposure and the possibility I have to research and to work problems out in full autonomy, thanks to the trust and support of my co-workers and hierarchical supervisors.
