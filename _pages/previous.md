## Doctorate at IMT Atlantique

Focused on multimodal ocean data processing, my Ph.D. Thesis sought to answer the question 
> "How can we exploit the complementary information conveyed by diverse, multi-sensor and spatio-temporally heterogeneous data to improve the characterization of the sea surface state?"

This was framed as a geophysical inverse problem. The methodological approach involved an end-to-end trainable frameworkâ€”the 4DVarNet. This framework is conceived to bridge traditional, physics-based geophyisical inversion schemes and modern data-driven methodologies. The objective is to make the most of theoretical foundations, the flexibility of deep learning modelling and the availability of large data sets.

We contributed with two original papers and one conference proceeding. In the following, a brief description of the main work axes.

#### Processing two-dimensional sea surface wind speed fields


#### Processing local underwater acoustics to retrieve sea surface wind speed
